OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building `pipelines` using link:https://tekton.dev[Tekton]. Tekton is a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating deployments across multiple platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc) by abstracting away the underlying details.

OpenShift Pipelines features:

* Standard CI/CD pipeline definition based on Tekton
* Build images with Kubernetes tools such as `S2I`, `Buildah`, `Buildpacks`, `Kaniko`, etc
* Deploy applications to multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, serverless and VMs
* Easy to extend and integrate with existing tools
* Scale `pipelines` on-demand
* Portable across any Kubernetes platform
* Designed for microservices and decentralized teams
* Integrated with the OpenShift Developer Console

This tutorial walks you through `pipeline` concepts and how to create and run a simple `pipeline` for building and deploying a containerized app on OpenShift.

In this tutorial you will:

* Learn about Tekton concepts
* Install `tasks`
* Create a `pipeline`
* Add `pipelineresources`
* Trigger a `pipelinerun`
* Deploy a sample application on OpenShift from a `pipelinerun`
