`Tasks` consist of a number of steps that are executed sequentially. Each step is executed in a separate container within the same `task` pod. `Tasks` can have inputs and outputs in order to interact with other `tasks` as part of the `pipeline`.

Here is an example of a Maven task for building a Maven-based Java application:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: maven-build
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: workspace-git
      targetPath: /
      type: git
  steps:
  - name: build
    image: maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim
    command:
    - /usr/bin/mvn
    args:
    - install
----

When a `task` starts running, it starts a pod and runs each step sequentially in a separate container on the same pod. The `task` above happens to have a single step, but `tasks` can have multiple steps, and, since these steps run within the same pod, they have access to the same volumes in order to cache files, access configmaps, secrets, etc. `Tasks` can also receive inputs (e.g., a git repository) and produce outputs (e.g., an image in a registry) in order to interact with each other.

For each step as part of a `task`, an image is declared that will be used to host the step as it executes. In the example above, the image specified is `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim`. The `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim` image allows the step to execute a `mvn install` command to add an artifact to a local repository.

As mentioned previously, only the requirement for a git repository is declared on the `task` above and not a specific git repository to be used. This allows `tasks` to be reusable for multiple `pipelines` and purposes. You can find more examples of reusable `tasks` in the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[Tekton Catalog] and link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog[OpenShift Catalog] repositories.

Install the `openshift-client` and `s2i-java-8` tasks from the catalog repositories using `oc`.

Create the `s2i-java-8` `task` that will define and build a container image for a Java 8 application and push the image to an image registry:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f tektontasks/s2i-java-8-task.yaml
----

Create the `openshift-client` `task` that will deploy the image created by `s2i-java-8` as a container on OpenShift:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f tektontasks/openshift-client-task.yaml
----

**NOTE**: For convenience, the `tasks` have been copied from their original locations in the Tekton and OpenShift catalog git repositories to the workshop.

You can take a look at the list of installed `tasks` using the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli[Tekton CLI] (`tkn`):

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn task ls
----

You should see similar output to this:

[source,bash]
----
NAME               AGE

s2i-java-8         1 minute ago
