For this tutorial we're going to use a simple nodejs application. The workshop is configured to provide you a pre-created project. We can verify the name of the project with:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc project -q
----

Building container images using build tools such as `S2I`, `Buildah`, `Kaniko`, etc require privileged access to the cluster. OpenShift default security settings do not allow access to privileged containers unless specifically configured.

This workshop has created a `ServiceAccount` with the required permissions to run privileged pods for building images. The name of this service account is easy to remember. It is named `pipeline`. You can verify that `pipeline` has been created by running the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc get serviceaccount pipeline
----

You will use the link:https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex[nodejs-ex] sample application during this tutorial, which is a simple nodejs application.

Create the Kubernetes objects for deploying the nodejs-ex app on OpenShift by running the command below. The deployment will not complete since there are no container images built for the nodejs-ex application yet. That you will do in the following sections through a CI/CD pipeline.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f sampleapp/sampleapp.yaml
----

You should be able to see the deployment in the OpenShift Web Console.

To bring up the web console, click on the **Console** tab. From the **Projects** list, click on your project and the click on the **Workloads** tab. Alternatively click on this link:%console_url%/k8s/cluster/projects/%project_namespace%/workloads[workloads] link.

In the next section, you'll learn how to use Tekton `tasks`. Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
