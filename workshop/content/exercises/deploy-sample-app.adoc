For this tutorial, you're going to use a simple nodejs application. The workshop
is configured to provide you a pre-created OpenShift project (i.e., Kubernetes namespace)
where you will set up supplementary resources for your application for its eventual
deployment.

We can verify the name of the project with:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc project -q
----

You will use the link:https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex[nodejs-ex] sample application during this tutorial, which is a simple nodejs application.

Create the Kubernetes objects for deploying the nodejs-ex app on OpenShift by running
the command below. The deployment will not complete since there are no container images
built for the nodejs-ex application yet. That you will do in the following sections
through a CI/CD pipeline.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f sampleapp/sampleapp.yaml
----

To verify the resources needed to support nodejs-ex have been created, you can head
out to the OpenShift web console by clicking on the **Console** tab next to the
**Terminal** tab at the center top of the workshop in your browser.

Make sure you select the **Developer** option from the dropdown in the top left
corner of the web console as shown below:

Next, select the Project dropdown menu shown below and choose the project namespace you have
been working with. As a reminder, the project you are using is %project_namespace%.

Next, click on the **Topology** tab on the left side of the web console if you don't
see the what's in the image below. Once in the **Topology view**, you can see the deployment
config for the nodejs-ex application, which is what is shown in the image below:

You'll notice the white circle around the nodejs-ex deployment config. This means
that nothing is actually running yet in your OpenShift project. The resources created
are supplementary to the application, such as a route (i.e., url).

Head back over to the terminal by clicking on the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console**
tab that you used to get the web console.

In the next section, you'll learn how to use Tekton `tasks`. Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
