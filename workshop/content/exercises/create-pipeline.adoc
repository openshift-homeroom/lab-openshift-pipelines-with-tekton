A `pipeline` defines a number of `tasks` that should be executed and how they interact
with each other via their inputs and outputs.

In this tutorial, you will create a `pipeline` that takes the source code of a nodejs
application (i.e., link:https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex[nodejs-ex]) from GitHub
and then builds and deploys it on OpenShift using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#build-strategy-s2i_understanding-image-builds[Source-to-Image (S2I)].

Below is a YAML file that represents the above pipeline:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: deploy-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    type: git
  - name: app-image
    type: image
  tasks:
  - name: build
    taskRef:
      name: s2i-nodejs
    params:
      - name: TLSVERIFY
        value: "false"
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: app-git
      outputs:
      - name: image
        resource: app-image
  - name: deploy
    taskRef:
      name: openshift-client
    runAfter:
      - build
    params:
    - name: ARGS
      value: "rollout latest nodejs-ex"
----

This `pipeline` performs the following:

1. Clones the source code of the application from a git repository (i.e., `app-git` resource)
2. Builds the container image using the `s2i-nodejs` `task` that generates a Dockerfile for the application and uses link:https://buildah.io/[Buildah] to build the image
3. The application image is pushed to an image registry (i.e., `app-image` resource)
4. The new application image is deployed on OpenShift using the `openshift-cli` `task`

The `pipeline` definition above shows how `tasks` can be added to a `pipeline`.
Each `pipeline` has a tasks property. Under this property, each `task` has a name.
For this `pipeline`, it has two `tasks` named build and deploy. The taskRef property under each
`task` name is where the `tasks` you just created can be specified as part of the `pipeline`.

You might have noticed that there are no references to the nodejs-ex git repository
and its image in the registry. That's because `pipelines` in Tekton are designed to
be generic and reusable across environments and stages through the application's lifecycle.
`Pipelines` abstract away the specifics of the git source repository and image to be
produced as `pipelineresources`. When triggering a `pipeline`, you can provide different
git repositories and image registries to be used during a `pipeline` execution. You
will do that in a little bit in the next section.

For the deploy `task` of the `pipeline`, you can see under the params property that
a value is passed: `"rollout latest nodejs-ex"`. This argument is how `oc rollout latest nodejs-ex`
will be run for the oc step of the `openshift-client` `task`. This command deploys
an image called nodejs-ex that has the tag latest associated with it, meaning the
most recently pushed version of the image.

The execution order of `tasks` is determined based on the dependencies that are
defined between the `tasks` via `inputs` and `outputs` as well as explicit orders
that are defined via `runAfter`. You'll notice the deploy `task` above has a runAfter
property specifying to only execute after the build `task` is complete.

Create the Pipeline
-------------------

The command below uses `oc` to take the `pipeline` definition from above from a
local directory and then creates it in your OpenShift project. Run the command to
create the `pipeline`:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f exercise/deploy-pipeline.yaml
----

You can see the `pipeline` you have created using `tkn`:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn pipeline ls
----

In the next section, you will focus on creating Tekton `pipelineresources`.
Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
