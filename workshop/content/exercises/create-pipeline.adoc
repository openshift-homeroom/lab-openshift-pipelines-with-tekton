A `pipeline` defines a number of `tasks` that should be executed and how they interact with each other via their inputs and outputs.

In this tutorial, you will create a `pipeline` that takes the source code of a Java Spring Boot application (i.e., Spring PetClinic) from GitHub and then builds and deploys it on OpenShift using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#build-strategy-s2i_understanding-image-builds[Source-to-Image (S2I)].

Below is a YAML file that represents the above pipeline:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: deploy-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    type: git
  - name: app-image
    type: image
  tasks:
  - name: build
    taskRef:
      name: s2i-java-8
    params:
      - name: TLSVERIFY
        value: "false"
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: app-git
      outputs:
      - name: image
        resource: app-image
  - name: deploy
    taskRef:
      name: openshift-client
    runAfter:
      - build
    params:
    - name: ARGS
      value: "rollout latest spring-petclinic"
----

This `pipeline` performs the following:

1. Clones the source code of the application from a Git repository (i.e., `app-git` resource)
3. Builds the container image using the `s2i-java-8` `task` that generates a Dockerfile for the application and uses link:https://buildah.io/[Buildah] to build the image
4. The application image is pushed to an image registry (i.e., `app-image` resource)
5. The new application image is deployed on OpenShift using the `openshift-cli`

You might have noticed that there are no references to the PetClinic Git repository and its image in the registry. That's because `Pipelines` in Tekton are designed to be generic and reusable across environments and stages through the application's lifecycle. `Pipelines` abstract away the specifics of the Git source repository and image to be produced as `pipelineresources`. When triggering a `pipeline`, you can provide different Git repositories and image registries to be used during a `pipeline` execution. You will do that in a little bit in the next section.

The `tasks` execution order is determined based on the dependencies that are defined between the `tasks` via `inputs` and `outputs` as well as explicit orders that are defined via `runAfter`. You'll notice the `deploy` task above has a `runAfter` specifying to only execute after the `build` task is complete.

To create the `pipeline` above, you will have the option of using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or using the OpenShift Web Console:

= OpenShift CLI

The command below uses `oc` to take the `pipeline` definition from above from a local directory and then creates it in your OpenShift project. Run the command to create the `pipeline`:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f exercise/deploy-pipeline.yaml
----

= OpenShift Web Console

Alternatively, in the OpenShift web console, you can click on **Add &#8594; Import YAML** at the top right of the screen while you are in the **pipelines-tutorial** project, paste the YAML into the textfield, and click on **Create**.

You can check the list of `pipelines` you have created using the Tekton CLI(`tkn`):

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn pipeline ls
----

The output should be similar to what is shown below:

----
NAME             AGE              LAST RUN   STARTED   DURATION   STATUS
deploy-pipeline  25 seconds ago   ---        ---       ---        ---
