You can watch the execution of a `pipelinerun` through the OpenShift web console
by clicking on the **Console** tab next to the **Terminal** tab at the center top
of the workshop in your browser.

Make sure you select the **Developer** option from the dropdown in the top left
corner of the web console as shown below:

Next, select the Project dropdown menu and choose the project namespace you have
been working with. As a reminder, the project you are using is called %project_namespace%.

Once you have selected your project, click on the **Pipelines** tab on the left
hand side of the web console. You will see the name of the `pipeline` and, under
the **Last Run** column, the name of the current `pipelinerun`. Click on the `pipelinerun` name:

After clicking on the `pipelinerun` name, you should see the `tasks` as part of
your `pipeline` executing similar to whats displayed below:

By hovering your cursor over the build `task`, you can see the steps that the `task`
will execute. You can also do this with the deploy `task`.

Since this is not the official OpenShift 4.2 web console, you will not be able to
view the logs through the web console, but this will be available in the official
OpenShift 4.2 web console release.

To verify the `pipelinerun` executed successfully, head back to the terminal by
clicking on the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console** tab at the center top of
the workshop in your browser.

Once you see the successful deployment verification message shown below, you can
go out and see the application running on OpenShift:

[source,bash]
----
[deploy : oc] deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/nodejs-ex rolled out
----

If you do not see the message, just wait a minute as the `pipelinerun` finishes and
watch the logs continue to come in from `tkn`.

You can confirm the successful deployment after the logs show the output above by
running the `tkn` command you ran earlier to list the `pipelineruns`:

[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
tkn pr ls
----

Under the STATUS column of the output, you should see Succeeded if the `pipelinerun`
was successful. You can also see how long the `pipelinerun` took to execute under the DURATION column.

To see the application you have deployed, click Continue to head to the next section.
