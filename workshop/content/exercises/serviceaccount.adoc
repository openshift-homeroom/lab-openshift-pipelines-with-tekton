In this workshop, the `pipeline` you create will use tools such as `S2I` and `Buildah`
to create a container image for an application and build the image.

Building container images using build tools such as `S2I`, `Buildah`, `Kaniko`, etc.
require privileged access to the cluster. OpenShift default security settings
do not allow access to privileged containers unless specifically configured.

This workshop has created a `ServiceAccount` with the required permissions to run
privileged pods for building images. The name of this service account is easy to
remember. It is named pipeline.

You can verify that pipeline has been created by running the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc get serviceaccount pipeline
----

In addition to privileged security context constraints (SCC), the pipeline service
account also has the edit role. This will allow pipeline to push a container image
to OpenShift's internal image registry.

The pipeline service account will execute `pipelineruns` on your behalf. You will
see an explicit reference for a service account when you trigger a `pipelinerun`
later in this workshop. This is how you will connect the pipeline service account
to the `pipelinerun`.

For reference, you can add the permissions used by pipeline to a service account
using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands below:

[source,bash]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline

oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z pipeline
----

In the next section, you will set up the sample application on OpenShift that will
be deployed in this workshop. Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
