OpenShift Pipelines is provided as an add-on on top of OpenShift that can be installed via an operator that is available in the OpenShift OperatorHub.

The OpenShift Pipelines operator installs globally on the cluster and will then monitor and manage `pipelines` for every single user in the cluster.

To install the operator, you need to be a cluster administrator user. In this workshop environment, the operator has already been installed for you.
Nevertheless, this is the process we followed in order to install the operator.
These instructions are for reference, as you will not be able to see these screens
in the embedded console in the workshop due to your user's lack of the required privileges.

== Install process

To install the OpenShift Pipelines operator on an OpenShift 4 cluster, you would go
to the **Catalog > OperatorHub** tab in the OpenShift web console. You can see the
list of available operators for OpenShift provided by Red Hat as well as a community
of partners and open-source projects.

Next, you would click on the **Integration & Delivery** category to find the
**OpenShift Pipeline Operator** as shown below:

Click on **OpenShift Pipelines Operator**, **Continue**, and then **Install** as
shown below:

Leave the default values after clicking **Install**. The operator will install globally
and it will run in the `openshift-operators` project, as this is the pre-configured
project for all global operators. Click on **Subscribe** in order to subscribe to
the installation and update channels as shown below:

The operator is installed when you see the status updated from `1 installing` to `1 installed`
as shown in the photo below:

This operator automates installation and updates of OpenShift Pipelines on the cluster
as well as applying all configurations needed.

That's all. The operator now installs and manages OpenShift Pipelines on the cluster.
